    "text": "I recently enrolled in a Teaching Development Program (TDP) and in one of the modules we discussed Reflective Teaching. We don’t tend to see much of this in Statistics. Personally, throughout my undergraduate (and graduate) courses not once did anyone ask how I felt or what I thought. Everything was very structured, right or wrong, yes or no, proved correctly or not, with little room to reflect. I was encouraged by the TDP team to start a blog to do more reflection.\nThis blog will serve as a space to collect my jumbled thoughts, and perhaps spark a conversation. I’ll be giving some reflections as I grow throughout this new role, and share resources and stories as I see fit.\nThanks for reading!"

This will provide students with an opportunity to form meaningful connections and get advice on majors/minors, graduate school, careers, and more.\nI am happy to meet to discuss non-course related topics. Please reach out and we can set a time to meet either in person or over Zoom.\n\n\n✉️ Invitations for Conference, Seminars, Workshops, and Talks\nI would love to give a talk on any of my projects or provide a workshop on R coding, GitHub, or any other statistics or data science topic that is relevant to my work.\n\n\n👩‍🔬 Supervising\nI am a Teaching Stream faculty member, so I am not currently supervising students. Please reach out to other Professors in the department who are not indicated as being “Teaching Stream”.\n\n\n🗂️ Graduate Academic Assistantships (GAAs - Masters, and PhD students only)\nI am not actively looking for students, but if you’d like to be involved in my future Educational Leadership (teaching-related) projects, feel free to reach out. If a project come up where a graduate student could be hired, I will let you know!\n\n\n📝 Reference Requests\nI am happy to provide reference letters for Graduate programs, internships, and employment for students that I know well. This includes:\n\nCurrent and former students I’ve taught more than one time\nCurrent and former students I’ve taught only once, but were active in class and attended office hours\nCurrent and former students I’ve met through committees and can speak to their out-of-class activities\n\nMy Reference Letter Policy:\n\nI can write up to 5 references per student per term. These include reference letters for graduate schools, jobs, and scholarships.\nI need at least 3 weeks to write a reference.\nI need to agree to every reference request BEFORE you write my name down as a reference. Please do not assume!\nYou must provide me with a list of reference letters you need, and details on each application, including the due date, where I submit, what the application is for, and any other information that I may need to write your reference letter. Please compile this into a clear email or document that I can reference.\n\nFor example, if you are applying to a graduate program I highly recommend sending:\n\ninformation on where I submit to (online? via email?)\na link to the program/scholarship you are applying to, along with a brief description about the program\ndetails about why you are applying to a particular school/program\nyour career goals or future plans\na CV\ntranscripts\nany other information you may think is relevant.\n\n\n   Leave a note with your request and I'll get back to you. \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    Submit Form"

I must say, although the imposter syndrome creeps in and I have days where I doubt myself, I am really enjoying my job.\nOne thing I’m really enjoying is making my YouTube tutorials. It helps me prep for my STAT545 lecture, almost acting as a practice run, and allows me to use my video editing and social media experience in a creative way. I’ve heard that my students are also enjoying them, and sharing them with their friends in their labs who are looking to learn about doing research with R! I hope that I can teach STAT545 again so I can reuse my videos next year!\nI am also so impressed with my students this term. They really surprise me everyday (in mostly good ways!). They are so creative, driven, and such a joy to be around. It’s hard to believe this term has only four weeks of classes left before the exam period, and then another group of students will be in my classroom.\nTwo months down and many more (hopefully) to go!"
